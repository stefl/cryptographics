      Hide information inside a graphic

      
  .guttered
    %p
      This is a simple tool that helps you turn a secret piece of text into a graphic that's encrypted with a password and looks like this:
    %p
      %img{:src=>"/images/cryptographics-cryptographics.png", :width=>960, :height=>1200, :alt=>"This is the phrase 'cryptographs.io' encoded without a password"}
    %p
      Using cryptographics you can hide a secret in plain sight so that only someone with the password can
      %a{:href=>"/decode"} decode 
      it. Print out the images you make with this tool and put them on the wall of your home, laser-cut them, send access credentials using a postcard, wear your credit card details on a t-shirt and dare your friends to crack them, there's lots that you can do with this. You could turn a secret into anything you want, such as…

      About this project
    %p
      This is a two-day hack project coded and designed by

      in collaboration with artist and photographer

      This was one of the ~25 hacks that were made over a weekend at Digital Sizzle's

      held at South Place Hotel. The brief was to collaborate around using data in the creation of artworks.
%section#why
  .guttered
    %h2
      But why?
    %p
      There's a growing interest in security of information, and privacy around personal data, mainly in light of the revelations about governmental access and legal processes around what we assume is for our eyes only.
    %p
      By encoding information into a physical object, you take it offline, and you're in control of what it contains. You can also use it in interesting ways - perhaps a treasure hunt involving encrypted images placed in locations, or a message to your grandchildren encoded in an object, or for sending information to someone in an entirely offline way, or just making a statement about how passwords and security are part of everyday life nowadays.
    %p
      Let's say you encode your 1Password master password into an image and turn it into a poster that you hang in your office. It would look like a print from IKEA, but the password that you use to encrypt that password could be left in your will for your family to have after you die.
    %p
      You wouldn't leave your actual 1Password password with your lawyer in case they were hacked, and it would require two-factor authentication - the object and the password from your lawyer – to reveal the password.
    %p
      After your death your family would then have access to your digital estate.
    %p
      Digital legacy is just one use case for this technique, and this site will update with new applications and ideas as people suggest them.
