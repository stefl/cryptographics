        Take a piece of
        = succeed(",") do
          %a{:href=>"/pin"} secret information
        encrypt it with a password and turn it into an image that you can print out, turn into
        = succeed(",") do
          %a{:href=>"/object"} an artwork
        make into a
        = succeed(",") do
          %a{:href=>"/quilt"} quilt
        or put anywhere else you can put a two dimensional design.
      %p
        The image holds an encrypted version of whatever secret you choose to put into it, and can be decoded by anyone who you give the password to.
      %p
        This all happens without sending your password or secret over the internet.
      %p
        For the crypto-geeks, the encryption is via
        = succeed(".") do
          %a{:href=>"https://github.com/mdp/gibberish-aes"}
            OpenSSL compatible AES

      Keep this password safe — it's not stored anywhere by this service. No information is sent anywhere – this all happens locally in your browser.

        The image is generated locally, so this does not send any data via the web. This uses some modern HTML5 features, so if it doesn't work, please try using Google Chrome.

        %p
          To do this, the image is sent back to the server. It does not include the secret or password and does not log the image anywhere.

      About this project
    %p
      This is a two-day hack project coded and designed by
      %a{:href=>"http://twitter.com/stef"} Stef Lewandowski
      in collaboration with artist and photographer

        %a{:href=>"http://twitter.com/lovelylizz"} Liz Barile
    %p
      This was one of the ~25 hacks that were made over a weekend at Digital Sizzle's

        %a{:href=>"http://thedigitalsizzle.com/"}="#sizzle9"
