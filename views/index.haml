        Take a piece of secret information, encrypt it with a password and turn it into an image that you can print out, turn into an artwork, make into a quilt, or put anywhere else you can put a two dimensional design.
      %p
        The image holds an encrypted version of whatever secret you choose to put into it, and can be decoded by anyone who you give the password to.
      %p
        This all happens without sending your password or secret over the internet.

        Create a cryptographic
      %label{:for=>"secret"} What's your secret?
      %textarea#secret{:name=>"secret"} A very important thing that you want to keep secret
      %label{:for=>"password"} What will be the password for your image?
      %input#password{:type=>"text", :name=>"password", :value=> "A strong password"}
      %button#generate{:type=>"submit"} Generate cryptographics
    #send
      %form{:action=>"email", :method=>"post"}
        %h2
          Get this image as a download
        %label{:for=>"email"}
          %input#email{:name=>"email", :type=>"email", :placeholder=>"you@example.com"}
        %button#download{:type=>"submit"} Send this image to me
        %p
          To do this, the image is sent back to the server. It does not include the secret or password and does not log the image anywhere.
